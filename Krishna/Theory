1. There are typically 2 types of compilers,
one where the scanner scans tokens and simultaneously sends
them over to parser...and one where all tokens are generated
first and then passed on to scanner. Ours is second type.

2.Friend CLasses
A friend class in C++ is a class that is given special 
access to the private and protected members of another class.
When to Use Friend Classes?
When two classes need a tight relationship (e.g., a SymbolTable managing a tokenClass).
When efficiency is more important than strict encapsulation.
When you need controlled access to private data without exposing it publicly.

example in Parser.h in class tokenClass
